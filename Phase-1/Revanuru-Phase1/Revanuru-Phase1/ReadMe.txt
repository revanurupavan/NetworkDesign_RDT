2. List of files submitted:

A. Server3.py           - Program to execute the server
B. Client3.py 	        - Program to execute the client
C. test.txt   	        - Sample text file used to test the functionality of the code.
D. Design document      - Document describing the each class and data type used in the code ( Server3.py and Client3.py)


3. Steps required to execute the program

A. Install Python 2.7.5 shell (https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/)
B. Place the test.txt, server3.py and client3.py in the same folder. ( Recommended c:\python27\)
C. Run IDLE and open the file Server3.py and Client3.py
D. Run the server3.py and then client3.py
E. The output file - 'new.txt' will be created in the same directoy.



Individual Performance :

1. Intially started working with basic programs of python,as it was new language we are handling.
2. Internet support helped me get a clear idea about how to excute files on python and errors fixes.
3. Textbook (2.7section) gave a good idea of the operation to be executed and could get the results.
4. This is where my Team mate and me were at the same track, we really had to visit Teaching Assistant to know much information in as how to execute furthur.
5. TA suggestions were very helpfull and then we got a broad picture to extend the code with just few more operations that can deliver the demand.
6. Spent some time in writing the details of the code, describing each class and attaching screenshots to the 'Design.doc'. 
7. In the end, it was a team effort that made the project successful and the desired result was attained by learning all the operations and implementing them.

1. Started the project with initial reference as the prescribed text book,Python code given in the textbook was executed.
2. Later to extend the scope to file transfer rather than raw text message, started to search in internet. Internet codes were examples yet they we pretty complex for small operation such as file transfer.
3. Then my Team mate and me individually started building the code for file transfer and finally code succeed one way transfer ( Client to Server)
4. Sending back from server was complex, not as a code, but as a final output as both the files run together and there were errors.
5. Team mate's support was vital, although we were working on sending file from server to client individually since 2 days , he was one to reach the point first.
6. Then we finalised project, Read me file was one that i typed except 'Indiviual Performance' of his .
